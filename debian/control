Description: Gmail Desktop Notifier
 A gmail and google apps mail notifier for Ubuntu's Unity desktop. Some of the 
 feaures of gmailwatcher are:
     * Instant Notifications: Notifies about messages as soon as they arrives.
     * Multiple Accounts: Use multiple accounts flawlessly.
     * Google Apps: Supports Google mail for domain accounts too.
     * Preview: You don't have to open gmail everytime to check what is there,
       gmailwatcher shows a nice preview of your mailboxes.
     * Labels: Get notifications only for specified gmail labels.
     * Extra Info: Gmailwatcher also shows additional info like stars or
       custom labels in preview.
